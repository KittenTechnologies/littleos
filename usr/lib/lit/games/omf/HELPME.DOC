Anti-Virus False Positive
-------------------------
Our testers have reported that some antivirus packages find a virus, 
(Whisper, Whisper Tai-Pan, or Tai-Pan 438) in OMF versions 2.0 or greater,
particularly in the file FILE0001.EXE.  We have examined this matter
extensively and verified that the indication of this virus in OMF is a
FALSE POSITIVE (i.e. the file was tagged as infected, but that virus is
not present in the file).  

=============================================================================
			     Version history
=============================================================================

  * Version 1.0.  The initial release of OMF in 10/95.
  * Version 1.1.  Fixed a problem in version 1.0, which sometimes caused the
    game to crash after you fought Raven in the tournament.
  * Version 2.0.  Current version which adds the options of modem and network
    play to OMF.  You can also call up a BBS running the OMF Challenge Arena
    software and play other callers as if you were networked.
  * Version 2.1.  All of the same Multiplayer/Arena options but fixed 
    several bugs created by version 2.0.

	- Fixes the scoring bug in v2.0
	- Fixes joystick problems in normal games (not modem/net games)


NOTE: For two-player modem/net/serial games, different versions of OMF are
not compatible.  Make sure both players have the same version of OMF before
starting a two-player game.

=============================================================================
		      Common problems and solutions
=============================================================================

Running with WINDOWS
--------------------
To run this game under Windows 3.x, be sure to run the file "OMF.PIF" (not
the file "OMF.EXE").  

OMF may work under Windows 95 on some computers.  However, if you have any
problems running under Windows 95, you'll have to run OMF from DOS Mode
instead.

OMF does not work reliabily under Windows 3.x with sound on.  Please run
SETUP and select "No Sound Card" under setup if you need to OMF from
Windows.

Running with OS/2
-----------------
Though One Must Fall will work reliably under OS/2 on some computers, we
don't recommend this because it might result in the game locking up.
Please run One Must Fall through DOS instead.  We tried to make
this game compatible with OS/2,  but alas we were not successful.

=============================================================================
		      HOW TO BOOT YOUR COMPUTER CLEAN
=============================================================================
			    
If you're having problems running OMF, you might be able to get it
up and running by "Booting your computer clean".  By this, we mean starting
up your computer without loading all of the little memory managers and
device drivers that might interfere with the game.  It's a relatively
simple process, so please bear with us.

If you have DOS 5.0
-------------------

   Please skip this section if you have DOS 6.0 or later!
   You need to create a "boot disk" to allow you to start your computer
   without loading all the TSR's and memory managers that take away
   memory.  Here's how.

   A. Put a blank disk in your A: drive and format it as a DOS disk.  (Don't
      do this in your B: drive - it won't work!)  To do this, type the
      following command:

      FORMAT A: /S

   B. Wait while your computer formats the disk.
   C. Label the disk "Boot Disk" and keep it handy.  You'll need this
      disk whenever you want to start OMF.

   Now, you can reboot your computer and play OMF:

   A.  Put the boot disk in your A: drive.
   B.  Restart your computer,  either by pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE,  by
       hitting your reset button,  or by turning it on.
   C.  Wait while your computer boots from the boot disk.
   D.  After a little while, your computer will stop and give you the A>
       prompt.
   E.  Now change to your hard disk by typing C:
   F.  Go into the Tyrian directory by typing CD\OMF
   G.  Begin by typing OMF

If you have DOS 6.0 or later
----------------------------

   Reboot your computer by pressing RESET or Ctrl-Alt-Del.  Wait for the
   message "Starting MS-DOS..." to come up.  Now press the [F5] key.

   This will cause DOS 6.0 to bypass all of your TSR's, memory managers,
   and other programs which normally occupy main memory.

   Now change into the OMF directory and begin the game.

			  GENERNAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
=============================================================================

NOT ENOUGH FREE MEMORY
----------------------

Q:  When I run OMF, the game refuses to start and gives me the 
    message "You need (amount) of free memory to run this program".
A:  To run One Must Fall,  you'll need:
   
   * At least 540K of free conventional memory
   * At least 2.5 megs of higher (XMS/EMS) memory.
   
   Here's what you need to do:

   1. Make sure you have at least 4 megabytes of memory installed in your
   computer!  You'll need this much in order to have 2.5 megs free.

   2. If you are trying to run OMF from Windows, completely exit
   Windows and try running it from DOS.

   3. If you are trying to run OMF from "DOSSHELL" or any other menu
   program,  please exit from the menu program.  Then, run OMF from the
   DOS prompt.  Menu programs often occupy enough memory that there won't
   be enough left for the game.

   4. If none of the above help, you can solve this problem quickly by
   "Booting your computer clean".  See above for details!

Q: When I run OMF with a normal boot, it tells me "not enough XMS."  Then
   when I do a clean boot by pressing F5 during startup, I don't have enough 
   free conventional memory.  AAARRG!
A: This often occurs on systems running DoubleSpace or DriveSpace, in which
   these drivers are loaded up AUTOMATICALLY, even with a clean boot 
   (otherwise your computer could not access the compressed space!).  
   The solution for this problem becomes slightly more complicated than a 
   clean boot, but here are a few suggestions:

   1. The easiest method of freeing enough memory for OMF to run is by 
   making a special boot disk.  Follow the procedures explained above to
   make a standard boot disk.  When the disk has finished formatting, 
   do the following:

   A)  Copy your CONFIG.SYS from your hard drive to the boot disk:
	(eg. COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS A:\)
   
   B)  Use the DOS Editor or another text editor to open the CONFIG.SYS
	which is now on your boot disk (DO NOT Edit the CONFIG.SYS on your 
	Hard Drive unless you know exactly what you're doing!)
	
	*  For the DOS Editor, type: EDIT A:\CONFIG.SYS
   
   C)  Delete all of the lines from your CONFIG.SYS on your boot disk EXCEPT:
      
	DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
	DOS=HIGH

       *  For some sound cards, it may be neccessary to also load your sound 
       drivers which may be found in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and/or CONFIG.SYS
      
   D) Save the new CONFIG.SYS onto your boot disk.  Do this from the DOS 
	Editor by pressing ALT-F, then S.
   
   E) To exit the DOS Editor, press ALT-F, X

   F) Reboot your machine with the new boot disk in the A: drive, and proceed
	to start OMF normally through DOS.
   
   2. You may want to implement a Multi-Config startup menu with an option 
   to load only the above lines in your CONFIG.SYS.  Please refer 
   to the DOS menu for a detailed explanation on how to set this menu up (it 
   is fairly easy to do, but the syntax is precise enough that a lengthy 
   explanation would be required).

Q: When I run One Must Fall, the computer locks up or reboots.
A: Run SETUP and verify that your settings are correct. If you are
   not using a sound card, make sure that SETUP is set for "No Sound Card".
   If you are using a sound card, verify that:

   1. The correct options are specified in SETUP.  Check your address, IRQ,
   and DMA settings (most sound cards operate on DMA 1).  If you don't know
   your card's address, IRQ, and DMA settings, consult your manual for
   details on figuring them out.

   2. Make sure your sound card has no address, IRQ, or DMA conflicts with
   other cards in your system.  If your sound card works properly with other
   games, you can assume that there are no conflicts.  However, if your
   sound card does not work with other games,  you have a conflict.  See your
   sound card manual for details on fixing this.

Q: OMF runs slowly on my 386 or 486 computer.  What can I do?
A: Your computer or VGA card isn't as fast as the game would like.
   You can speed up the game by going into the "Configuration" and
   "Video Options" menus and turning off "Animation", "Palette Animation"
   and the other detail settings.

Q: While playing, I get dumped back to DOS with an error message. 
A: This means that either (1) OMF is conflicting with your memory
   managers and TSR's, or (2) you need more free memory to run OMF.
   Try booting clean and running OMF.

   Several Epic testers have reported errors when running OMF with
   QEMM.  We haven't been able to duplicate this problem or figure out
   its cause, but booting clean has always solved it.

Q: I can't seem to get ANYTHING on the screen.  I type OMF and the system
   "hangs".  What now?
A: Make sure you have the system requirements mentioned earlier in the
   manual.  If you do, you may have TSR's that conflict with OMF.  Remove
   the TSR's and try running OMF with a "clean boot" from a DOS
   diskette.

Q: My dad won't let me play past 11:00pm.  What can I do?
A: Wait till you're 18 then move out.  If you're over 18, wait till you
   get to your office to play.  Or you could get your dad hooked on the
   game so he'll be playing too!

=============================================================================
			     SOUND CARD NOTES
=============================================================================

Q: I can't seem to get any sound from OMF.  What did you do to me?
A: First, you must run the SETUP program that came with the game.  It
   will prompt you for settings for your sound card.  Make sure these
   are correct.  If you still don't hear anything, try running another
   program that uses the same card and make sure it works.  Make sure
   the settings in OMF match that of your other programs.

Q: The music sometimes skips like a broken record.
A: The "Sound Quality" setting is too high for your computer and
   sound card to handle.  Please run SETUP again and select a lower
   "Sound Quality" setting.  The Medium setting will give you okay sound
   quality, while avoiding most music problems.  If this doesn't cure the
   problem, try booting clean -- that will give OMF extra CPU power to
   handle the music and sound.

Q: The music and sound effects sound OK when I start OMF, but
   they get cut off several seconds after a song begins.
A: Whoops!  This is what happens when you select the wrong IRQ for
   your sound card!  Run SETUP again and pick the correct IRQ.

Pro Audio Spectrum Notes
------------------------

   One Must Fall should work fine with the PAS, PAS+, and PAS-16 sound cards.
   You need to run SETUP and tell it that you have a Sound Blaster card (not
   a Sound Blaster Pro).

   Important!  To run One Must Fall on any Pro Audio Spectrum sound card, you
   need to have the PAS drivers loaded properly.  OMF will only recognize
   your PAS card if the drivers are loaded.  See your PAS manual for
   instructions on loading the right PAS drivers in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and
   CONFIG.SYS files.  These drivers will not be loaded if you boot your
   computer clean.

Gravis UltraSound
-----------------

   One Must Fall requires that your GUS card has at least 512K of onboard
   RAM to play a GUS soundtrack.  Most new GUS cards meet this requirement, 
   but some older ones were shipped with only 256K.  If you do not have 
   512K of onboard RAM (on your GUS), try loading SBOS (in your AUTOEXEC.BAT)
   and setting up OMF for Sound Blaster emulation.

Other sound cards
-----------------

   Since new models of sound cards are always being manufactured and revised,
   sometimes a new sound card will come out that's not compatible with
   OMF.  Here's how to contact the top sound card makers for information about
   sound card problems and obtaining the latest driver files.

			 Modem and Network OMF Notes
==============================================================================

Advanced Setup Options
----------------------
 
For each of the previously mentioned methods of playing OMF over the modem, 
you can specify advanced setup options where necessary.  Just choose the 
method of play you wish and choose "Advanced Options."  The following is a 
list of parameters possible for the advanced options line.

Parameters:
-ADDR             To manually specify the prot address being used, enter
		  this parameter, followed by the port address.
-ACCEPT           Accept calls in the background as game plays.
-ANSWER           Wait for a call then answer the phone.
-ANSWERNOW        Answer immediately.
-BAUD <baud>      Set baud.  2400, 9600, 14400, 28800, 19200, 38400.
-COM <1/2/3/4>    Use COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4. Default is COM2.
-DIAL "<phone>"   Dial this phone number.
-INIT "<string>"  Your modem's init string (Default is "ATZ")
-IRQ #            For nonstandard IRQs, you can specify your modem's IRQ in 
		  this string.  Just replace the "#" symbol with the IRQ used.
-NO16550          If you have an older 8250 UART COM port, or your opponent 
		  does, use this setting (esp for Serial Link).
-ONLINE           My modem is already connected and online.
-SERIAL           Use direct serial link, not modem.
-SET <8N1/7E2>    Set data bits, parity, stop bits. Default is 8N1.
-TERM             Go into terminal mode so you can manually log in.

Speeding up Net/Modem/Serial play
---------------------------------

There are many factors that can cause OMF to run slowly over a network, 
modem or null modoem connection.  The following is a list of suggestions to
play OMF at a reasonable speed.

Game options:
  Speed - Because some slowdown is inherent in Modem/Net games, you may need
	to turn you "Speed" setting up.
  Video Options - Turning off Video options will also make gameplay faster.

Modem/BBS link:
  Make sure your init string turns OFF both Error Correction and Data 
  Compression.  Consult your manual for details.

Modem/Net Problems
------------------

Q: OMF plays really slow over modem/BBS link.  How can I speed it up?
A: Some suggestions are listed above in the "Speeding up Net/Modem/BBS Play"
   section.  Some factors which may slow down the game that you cannot 
   control are: line noise, the speed of your opponent's computer, your
   opponent's connection (baud rate and line noise on his/her end).

Q: Help!  I can't seem to connect with my friend by modem to play OMF.
A: Check to see that your init string is valid and each command in it is 
   performing the desired function (turn off error correction, for example).
   Consult your manual for details regarding your init string.  Also try 
   connecting at various baud rates.

Q: Net/Modem OMF won't recognize my modem because it's not using a standard
   IRQ.  What can I do?
A: Include the line:  -IRQ # (where "#" is the IRQ which your modem uses) in 
   the Advanced Options section where you set up your modem for OMF.  Other
   Advanced options are listed in this document or by typing NETMODEM -? at
   the OMF> prompt.

Q: I can connect with a friend to play OMF, but it "times out" or locks up
   during the game.
A: Make sure you and your friend are running under the same operating system.
   OMF will not work over network/modem/serial play if one computer is
   running under Windows and another under DOS.  If one person is using
   Windows 95, rebooting into MS-DOS MODE should allow OMF to work with
   another DOS system.
