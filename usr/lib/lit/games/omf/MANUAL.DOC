If you were one of those who installed the game, played it, then
wondered what the heck was going on, skip this paragraph -- it wasn't
meant for you. For those who actually read this file before trying the
game (who are probably also the type who keep their socks on those
little hangers they come with), we would like to THANK YOU for making all
the trouble of writing this manual worthwhile.  By reading this beforehand
you'll be the first to know how to do the special moves while the poor guy
down the street is still figuring out what the heck a pilot is.

This is, basically, a fighting game.  It is YEARS in the making, and is the
best effort of Rob Elam (the dude who does everything), Ryan Elam (the
older brother who can't wait to mooch off Rob's success), Josh Jensen
(sound code - assembler wizard), Kenny Chou (music master) and many
more. See the credits below.  It has many features not found in any other
fighting game. One Must Fall 2097 is a great way to relieve stress, improve
hand-eye coordination, or just generally waste enormous amounts of time.

Enjoy this manual. Print it out. Give it to your friends. Put it in
your bird cage. Buy the full game. 

Remember, if you like this text file, buy the OMF 2097 strategy guide. 
The guide is over 60 pages long and is jam-packed with useful tips and
secrets, lots of pretty pictures, hints on the pilots and robots,
and more.

A note on graphic violence:  Diversions Entertainment is devoted to
bringing non-violent PC entertainment to the public.  While you cannot
have a fighting game without some measure of violence, we are hoping to
show that a game with little shock value is still accepted by the
consumer. We want to prove that playability is more important to you
than simply slapping a few characters onto a screen and putting the
words "Blood", "Deadly", or "Violence" in the title.  As the one with
the checkbook, you will be the judge.

The year is 2097.  Friday.  You've waited for this night since you were
a child. Fifteen years of training will be used tonight - your future
career the main prize.

"The left elbow still needs a little work...  Just three more days! Move
the fight to next Friday and they won't know what hit 'em!"

Lying on the table, you can't see where the voice came from, but you
recognized the colorful language of Team Chief 'Plug' McEllis.
"Don't be nervous, Plug.  This 'bot is fresh from the factory and the
best there is." You reply, trying to hide the shaking in your own
voice. "I'll show you just how good a job your team did."

"I know you will.  It's just that this is your first match and your
opponent's tenth.  Should give you more time..."

Time to what?  Sim training gets old.  There's no simulator that can
compare with the real thing.  "I have to do it now.  The Board will see
me as a challenger and hothead. I need the edge to get in this season's
schedule."

"Good luck to ya... Give 'em an uppercut for me." says Plug.

The attendants begin checking your suit.  You can feel the small needles
in the helmet pressing into your skull.  Fifteen minutes to show time.
You feel a slight burning sensation as the drugs which connect you to
the super computer seep into your spine.  A cute attendant leans over
the bed and gives you a wink.

"Nighty night...  Remember me when you're famous."

Your eyes begin to shut.  You blink a few times, trying not to fight the
medication.  Finally, your eyes begin to close as you lose
consciousness.

METAL!  You can't believe the feeling!  Your eyes open, but they're not
your own.  You look at your hand and flex it into a fist.  You strike
the fist against your opposite palm and the sound is like two trains
smashing together. You realize you'll never get used to "jacking in,"
the feeling of power you get from suddenly becoming a few hundred tons
of dangerous equipment.

"You there, kid?" says a voice inside your head.

You now hear several voices in the background, "Physical attributes
steady. All systems mark."

You turn your head over to the body lying on the bed ten meters away and
almost 30 meters below.

You speak, your voice amplified a hundred times,  "I'm slice, Plug.
Let's do some crushin'!"

It is no longer blood you feel pumping, but Synthoil.  Your eyes now
show you heat dissipation factors, metal strength, weapon power, damage
scales, and some other figures so complicated you know to ignore them.
Even though you no longer have blood, it feels like your pulse is
climbing as the clock over the door nears 00:00.

"Zero hour. Let 'er roar!"

The door opens. The crowd cheers. The game begins.

Welcome to One Must Fall 2097. In this future, national governments are
puppets of the multinational corporations.  One such corporation, World
Aeronautics and Robotics (WAR), runs the entire show with a silk-covered
iron fist. "All's fair in love and WAR" is the most common phrase of the
day. WAR was started as a research institute to provide human-assisted
robots for space travel. Their first prototypes were activated in 2009 and
were immediately put to use by a conglomeration of companies from
Japanamerica to build the first ACTIVE space station (the first attempt at
a space station was abandoned by the later defunct United States of America
before becoming operational).  The HAR's were better than conventional
robots in that they were completely operated by a single human whose brain
controlled the robot's systems via remote.  The "pilot" actually "became"
the robot for all intents and purposes, but no danger to the pilot was
possible.

Now, WAR is Earth's leading corporation.  Every other company relies on
WAR for space travel to Earth's four off-world stations.  WAR provides
systems for governments and companies alike for security and defense.

WAR is power. And you're a part of it.

Ganymede, the next moon on Jupiter to be colonized, needs a WAR
representative to watch over it.  The Board at WAR has decided that the
applicants for the position, being equally qualified, should fight for
it. Now, the ten applicants must choose which HAR will be their weapon
and beat the others in a one-on-one competition.

Anyone who has even a remotely important position at WAR is trained in
the use of HAR's.  Most have spent considerable time "in" a real working
model to get the feel of it.  But the use of HAR's for sparring is a
completely new scheme brought about by the need to know that when one
company attacks another the 'bots can handle the stress. The idea of
using WAR robots for entertainment is a new one, but The Company
believes that it will be good press for the next prototypes from the WAR
design rooms. Therefore, the public is invited to view the proceedings.
It will be the greatest one-on-one combat since the Roman Era. Years of
training on the 'bots makes you think you can take the other
pencil-pushers who show, and you know that your reason for being V.P. of
this hunk of rock is much better than any they could have.  As the 21st
century comes to a close, you prepare to put a big dent in the 22nd!


€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€  "To be a good captain, you'd better know
€€€ ONE MUST CHOOSE A PILOT €€€  how to steer."
€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€  - Captain Hazelwood

Listed below are the pilots and other important people of the game. 
You'll need to know the personalities of each pilot in order to choose
one effectively.

Crystal
=======

Age: 23
Specialty: Genetic Engineering

Crystal Devroe, and her brother Christian, are twin children of Dr. and
Mrs. Devroe.  Dr. Devroe was a head researcher for WAR five years ago,
and it was mostly his good name that gave Crystal and Christian their
positions in the company.  Though Devroe's research was held in highest
secrecy, Crystal knew it had something to do with biogenetic research.

Both her parents died five years ago, the only passengers in a shuttle
from Luna to Earth.  Her brother suspects murder, and though he won't
tell his suspicions, she does also.  The only clue she carries is a
DigiLink Access Code with the word "Nova" on it, found in her father's
briefcase.  She knows the power that Ganymede carries.  She knows that
Ganymede would mean access to WAR's Core computer system.  She believes
that WAR is responsible and that the access code will gain her entry
into the secret files and hopefully the information on what happened to
her parents.

Steffan
=======

Age: 17
Specialty: Sales and Marketing

The arrogant son of the Tommas family, one of the most influential
families in the Iolo colony on Luna, Steffan is for all practical
purposes a spoiled brat.  He believes himself the center of the Universe
and knows that Ganymede is simply another step to his final destination,
President of WAR. The fact that, at 17, he has the skill and brains of
someone twice his age only makes him seem that much more aloof.  In
combat, as in life, he tends to rely on a vicious onslaught of blows to
destroy his opponent.

Milano
======

Age: 35
Specialty: Security, Kick Boxing

Milano Angston, as only son of WAR founder Herbert Angston, has no need
for money.  Though Wright and Angston are now associated with their
company in name only, the family is wealthy beyond measure from the
nearly thirty years of success in WAR's early days.  At the age of 19,
Milano left his family and changed his last name to Steele.  He became
known internationally for his almost inhuman dexterity and Kickboxing
skill, and in 2090 was hired by Raven to become a security chief for WAR.
Milano never mentioned his family background, and secretly hopes to take
WAR back and use the company's power for the reasons originally intended
by his father.

Christian
=========

Age: 23
Specialty: Genetic Engineering, Jujitsu

Christian knows that the shuttle which carried his parents was destroyed
on purpose.  The passenger manifest listed thirty persons going aboard
the craft, and all the names on the list weren't real.  WAR killed his
parents, and he wants revenge.  The fact that his sister Crystal seems to
be in on the hunt only scares Christian.  He realizes the power of WAR and
is afraid for her safety.  When she applied for the Ganymede position, as
he knew she would, Christian vowed he would beat her himself just to keep
her from putting herself in the possibly dangerous position of Head of
Ganymede. His anger and bitterness are such that he never stops training
to win, and his opponents will agree that he is about the most aggressive
fighter in the contest.

Shirro
======

Age: 73
Specialty:  Public Relations, Karate

Shirro is the Head of Public Relations for all of WAR. It was his idea
to have this contest for the media coverage.  He believes that if the
event is popular enough, they may find a new business for the robots:
entertainment. Though Shirro knows much about what happens deep within
WAR, he never takes things too seriously and just hopes things will work
themselves out. Those who have seen him in martial arts tournaments
agree that he is both incredibly strong and tactful, always smiling and
shaking your hand after he beats you.

Jean-Paul
=========

Age: 27
Specialty: Market Analyst

John-Paul is an enigma.  During his childhood, it was found that he had
an uncanny ability to absorb information of any kind.  He would score
perfect on any test, and was hired at a young age for the first job WAR
could place him in.  The company has asked several times if he would
volunteer for "genetic research", but John-Paul knows that they simply
want to know how he can have such a perfect mind.  He also knows of the
corruption within WAR and hopes to gain enough support from other
companies to finally overthrow the larger "monster" before it does any
more damage.

In combat, John-Paul is calculating and has very well-rounded abilities.
He rarely ever speaks, but always seems to be calm and sure of himself.
He is as defensive in the arena as he is in public.

Ibrahim
=======

Age: 48
Specialty: Robotics Engineer

fA retired triathlete, Ibrahim believes in a sharp mind and body.
Probably the best designer of HAR's, he has under his belt the design of
the Jaguar, Mantis, and Omega 'bots.  The Jaguar is his most famous,
since the Mantis and Omega are mostly used for exploration of hostile
environments (EHE) missions.  Ibrahim is considered a mentor by many of
the pilots, as he is always seen in the docking bays making sure "his
babies" are being taken care of.  Ganymede will no doubt give him more
influence over new designs, and though he craves the position he still
wants to design the future 'bots. He cares little for the inner politics
of WAR, but simply loves the machines.

His knowledge of the internal workings of the HARs makes him a favorite
to win.  He often will take a few hits and then return fire with
incredible accuracy.

Angel
=====

Age: Unknown
Specialty: Unknown

Angel seemed to come out of nowhere.  When her name was announced as a
finalist for the position, reporters were astounded by the fact that not
only did she not have any known background, but she wasn't even an
employee of the company.

She never talks with the other finalists, and until the competition has
not even been seen.

Cossette
========

Age: 39
Specialty: Space Station Design

Fifteen years ago, a sport called The Arena was the most popular event
of the day.  Similar to HAR's, The Arena placed humans INTO a robot
frame, usually ten or fifteen meters in height.  The Arena players used
various controls to fight their opponents while the crowd looked on.
Cossette fought in The Arena until a tragic accident left her crippled
from the waist down.  Now she enjoys the feeling the HAR gives her, and
her success in designing two space stations has given her the
possibility of Ganymede.  Cossette also was instrumental in the design
of Electra, a 'bot designed from an electromagnetic crystal found on
Venus.

Cossette is very bitter about her injury, since so many have treated her
as inferior since the accident.  She is still very defensive in combat,
but should never be underestimated.

Raven
=====

Age: 26
Specialty: Bodyguard, Kick boxer

Nobody knows of Raven's life before becoming Kreissack's right-hand man,
but since coming on board in such an important position, he has
definitely made himself known.  He is brutal both in and out of any
competition, and has killed more than two dozen people "in self
defense".  Many believe that Kreissack wants Raven in the position at
Ganymede for his own devious purposes.  Raven himself does want the
position, but not for Kreissack. He believes Kreissack is an ambitious
fool and wants nothing more than to someday let one of the assassins
intended for Kreissack accidentally slip through security and hit his
mark.

Major Kreissack
===============

Age: 103
Specialty: President of WAR

Kreissack is responsible for the success of WAR. It is rumored that
there is much more to the new colony than is known by the general
public. Many say that he is preparing to declare himself a new Emperor
of the solar system.  This threat is weighed heavily by his known armada
of HAR's and the mysterious Nova Project he's spent the last two years on.


€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€  "In the end, the one with the biggest gun

In OMF 2097,  your most important decision is your choice of robots.
Here are the robots available:

 Jaguar 

Creator..........: Ibrahim Hothe
Creation Date....: December 4, 2070
Special Abilities: Jaguar Leap, Concussion Cannon, Overhead Throw

The Jaguar is the ultimate rich man's toy.  Many companies hire
full-time Jaguar pilots and 'bots as bodyguards.   The speed of this
robot is nearly unsurpassed in a unit of its size.  Though it was the
first ever security-intended HAR, it still holds weight as the most
versatile.

Using its incredible speed and dexterity, the Jaguar is capable of
leaping more than twice its height and delivering a blow strong enough to
crush buildings.  It has a Smith & Winston 100-Ton Concussion Cannon,
which is primarily used for crowd control.  Also, the unit can jump over
any large enemy, grab it while upside down, and before the enemy has
time to react throw it more than 100 meters doing amazing damage.


 Chronos 

Creator .........: Arjan Schmalz
Creation Date ...: October 31, 2072
Special Abilities: Small-Scale Teleportation, Matter Phasing,
                   Stasis Activator

The Chronos HAR was designed to lend a few precious moments to space
ship rescue.  It comes in several sizes, from 1.5 meters to the largest
27.5 meter model.  The main feature of the Chronos is its Stasis Field
Generator, a diamond-shaped machine in the middle of it's chest.  The
robot is designed and built to channel the energies from this machine
for various uses during time-critical rescue missions.

The energy from the Generator can be focused on the mech itself, causing
it to phase out and reappear nearby.  This helps the 'bot get to
locations much faster than running, while taking less energy than
conventional matter transfer.  When the Chronos comes against solid
matter, it can center the Generator on that matter to form a brief
doorway, allowing passage through the solid material to its destination.
Probably the unit's greatest use centers on the Stasis Activator that
the Generator can expel.  When this Activator connects with solid
matter, it forms a Stasis Field which stops time for a brief period.
This is especially useful for containing explosions, slowing effects of
poison on a living creature, or stopping objects in motion.

Many companies have also noted the possible uses of Chronos in combat
situations.


 Thorn 

Creator .........: Cliff Brussee
Creation Date ...: July 4, 2074
Special Abilities: Speed-Kick, Off-Wall Attack, Spike-Charge

A real favorite among the populace, the Thorn unit was the first to use
monofilament technology.  The points of the "spikes" come to a single
molecule, which gives Thorn a punch that can cut through normal metal
like it is paper.  This HAR can use its spikes to attack in several
different ways.  His long legs also provide a powerful weapon at medium
range.


 Pyros 

Creator .........: James Sweeney
Creation Date ...: June 5, 2076
Special Abilities: Fire Spin, Super Thrust Attack, Jet Swoop

The colossal Pyros unit is used primarily for space station design.
Normally, the unit is equipped with a huge array of tools necessary to
keep deep-space machinery in working condition.  It uses its various jet
systems to move itself between various objects in space without needing
a shuttle or external jet pack.

In combat, the Pyros is a formidable arsenal of flame.  It can change
the direction in the air, jump forwards and backwards while attacking,
and can "swoop" down on an enemy with a powerful blow.  Pyros does lack
in the speed department, but the damage caused by its flame throwers
more than makes up for its sluggish movement.


 Electra 

Creator .........: Cossette Akira
Creation Date ...: March 8, 2077
Special Abilities: Ball Lightning, Rolling Thunder, Electric Shards

In the early stages of the exploration of Jupiter, it was realized that
almost no electronic equipment could function in the incredible storms
of the planet's surface.  Using a crystal found only on Jupiter's moon
Io, scientists were able to create Electra, a HAR capable of
withstanding any type of charged particle.  Though the crystal is very
strong, it is also one of the most expensive molecules in existence.
Until this contest, the Electra unit was seldom seen in public.

As a combat robot, Electra is formidable.  Not only is it fast, but even
a touch from its hands can short circuit normal machinery.  It can form
a flying ball of lightening which lasts for a short duration and
explodes for damage capable of turning a house into rubble.  Electra can
also fly forward, rolling itself into a ball and striking with
considerable force.  For defense, the unit can send small shards of
electric force which do a small amount of damage but is good for keeping
an enemy at arm's length.


 Katana 

Creator .........: Hans Kreissack
Creation Date ...: November 10, 2078
Special Abilities: Rising Blade, Head Stomp, Razor Spin

Often advertised as "The Ultimate Weapon", Katana is nothing more than
deadly force.  Using monofilament blades for hands, this unit can carve
through a five-meter-thick wall of solid lead in less than ten seconds.
Behind the blades are two very strong legs which allow the Katana to
perform some amazing offensive maneuvers.

The Katana can jump, extending one arm upward, high enough to knock
airplanes out of the sky.  It can use its powerful legs to stomp on an
enemy.  It can also leap towards a wall, then use the force of the
rebound to turn itself into a spinning mass of sharp steel.


 Shredder 

Creator .........: Marcus Knight
Creation Date ...: February 30, 2086
Special Abilities: Head-Butt, Flip Kick, Flying Hands

Originally intended for mining operations, the Shredder now sees plenty
of combat time.  One of the fastest HAR's, this unit can stun an enemy
before it can form an adequate defense.  The hands on the mech can
actually be thrown at an enemy and the magnetic systems on the arms will
return the hands back to the body.  Shredder can also hurl itself
head-first at an enemy, causing the blade on top of its head to do
considerable harm.  The unit's "Flip Kick" is a favorite move of many
pilots, since it can jump over projectiles and then hit the source with
incredible speed.


 Flail 

Creator .........: Stephen Jamison
Creation Date ...: May 19, 2083
Special Abilities: Spinning Throw, Charging Punch, Swinging Chains

This 'bot is the greatest thing to happen to general construction work
since the hammer.  Capable of building and demolition, it uses its five
ton chains for the heavier jobs.  This unit will be the primary model used
for the initial colonization of Ganymede.

When used for combat purposes, Flail's chains come in handy. Most of the
special offensive maneuvers center around the use of these chains as
weapons. Also, Flail can use its powerful Charging Punch, which is
guaranteed by WAR to level any mortar wall built by man.


 Gargoyle 

Creator .........: Marcus Knight
Creation Date ...: March 16, 2068
Special Abilities: Diving Claw, Flying Talon, Wing Charge

Built for reconnaissance missions by the famous designer Marcus Knight,
the Gargoyle's power is in its titanium wings.  Not only is this robot
tough enough to leave and reenter the Earth's atmosphere, but it is
dexterous enough to fly well below any conventional RADAR sensors.  It
has built-in sensor countermeasures, making it a company favorite.

If you ever DO spot a Gargoyle, it is certainly built to defend itself.
Designed from a titanium alloy, its hollow skeletal structure is both
lightweight and strong.  It's most used attack is to grab a victim, fly
it high into the air, and either slam it against the ground or into
another object.  Sharp talons, feet, and beak provide a secondary
defense not to be taken lightly.


 Shadow 

Creator .........: Unknown
Creation Date ...: January 2096
Special Abilities: Shadow Dive, Shadow Punch, Shadow Slide, Shadow Grab

Probably the most secretive project in the last twenty years, the Shadow
robot definitely earns its name.  Somehow, the Shadow is capable of
generating quasi-real projections of itself.  A single Shadow robot can
at times replace half a dozen conventional 'bots.  Unfortunately, the
projections don't last for very long and any damage done to them is
"felt" by the host robot.

Since this is the newest HAR in the company's arsenal, many pilots find
it hard to compete against and hard to fight with.  Once it is mastered,
though, it is a weapon to be reckoned with.  WAR is still trying to
measure it's purpose in future missions.


€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€  "It's not whether you win or... Okay,

€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€  - A. Hitler

To play OMF, you can use the keyboard or joystick.  We highly recommend a
Gravis Gamepad or similar digital joystick.

Once you're into the game, you choose your pilot.  Each pilot has
different strengths and weaknesses.  You may want one that is faster, or
that can take a punch or two, or one that just looks good.

Next, you choose the robot you want to fight against.  Each robot is
completely different - some are fast and agile, others are slow and
strong.  Again you can enjoy a different game every time by choosing
different pilot/robot combinations.  Fun, eh?

After you choose your robot, you'll be shown your first opponent and
into the ring you go!

Once you're in the arena duking it out, you can press ESC to bring up
the arena menu.  From here you can fine-tune the way the game runs on
your machine, change music/sound volumes, and forfeit the match.  You
can also press 'P' to pause the game (pressing ESC also pauses the game
while the menu is displayed).

The energy meter at the top shows how much damage your robot can take
before shutdown.  Every successful strike against you lowers that total.
If this bar goes below zero, the pilot and robot will collapse.

Some arenas have "hazards" that can damage your robot.

JUMPING: You can jump by pressing up.  Press up along with left or
   right to jump diagonally.  If you press down,  then press up,  you'll
   jump higher.

PUNCHING: Press the first joystick button or the Enter key.

KICKING: Press the second joystick button or the right Shift key.

BLOCKING: To block an attack,  press back (away from your opponent).
   You can only block air attacks while standing, and you can only
   block sweep (low) attacks while kneeling.

€€€ ONE MUST HAVE ADDENDUMS €€€€  MODEM/NETWORK PLAY!?!?
€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€

Yes!  The latest version of OMF has Modem, Network, and Serial support so
you can battle your friends from afar, or hold tournaments over a network.
These features were not included in the initial release, and the changes
are detailed below.

Playing OMF by Modem
--------------------
For full speed action in a modem game of OMF, all you need is a 9600 baud
or faster modem.

Here's how to play:

	1. Begin OMF normally by running the OMF.EXE file (see above,
	   "To Start One Must Fall").
	2. Choose "Network/Modem Game" from the main menu.
	3. Choose "Modem Link" at the next menu.
	4. Choose "Select Modem Brand" at the next menu.  If your modem 
	   is not listed , try selecting "Standard 9600" or "Standard 14.4".
	5. Choose "Select Speed" to choose your modem speed.  Some, but not 
	   all 14.4 modems may connect at higher baud rates when error 
	   correction and data compression are disabled.
	6. "Select COM Port" to tell OMF which port your modem communicates 
	   through.
	7. Choose "Call a Friend & Begin" or "Wait for a call & Begin" to 
	   connect with someone via modem, and begin playing OMF.
	   Note: If you are calling a friend, you may disable your "Call 
	   Waiting" by typing *70 in front of the phone number you're calling.

	* You should only have to do steps 4, 5, and 6 the first time you 
	  run a modem game of OMF.

Playing OMF by Serial Link
--------------------------
You can connect two computers with a "null modem cable" and play OMF.

Once you've hooked a cable between the two computers, do this:

	1. Run OMF.
	2. Choose "Network/Modem Game".
	3. Choose "Serial Link" at the next menu.
	4. Choose "Serial Port" to select which port the null modem cable 
	   is connected to.
	5. Choose "Serial Speed" to set the speed of the Serial Port.
	   We recommend 9600 baud; this is fast enough for OMF to play
	   at its maximum speed.  Faster baud rates may work less
	   reliably on some computers.
	6. Choose "Begin Serial Game" to connect the two computers and play
	   OMF.

	* You should only have to do steps 4 and 5 once to let OMF recognize
	  your hardware.

Playing OMF on an IPX Network
-----------------------------
OMF can also be played on any network which supports the IPX network protocol.
	
	1. Run OMF.
	2. Choose "Network/Modem Game" from the main menu.
	3. Choose "Begin IPX Game" to begin a network game of OMF.

	Note: for some LAN based networks which use multiple network
	segments (hubs), you may need to specify which segments to include
	in the "Advanced Options".  For example, type: -N 1 -N 2 -N 3
	to include hubs 1, 2, and 3.

For other Advanced Options, and Modem/Net/Serial troubleshooting tips,
consult the HELPME.EXE file.

The OMF Challenge Arena
-----------------------

Once you've connected - by modem, serial link, network, or BBS link - you 
enter the "Challenge Arena."  Enter your name or alias and you will appear 
in the Challenge Arena.

The Challenge Arena displays information about each player presently 
connected: 

       Name   Your name, of course, or an alias
     Action   Available, Pondering, Challenging, or VS (fighting)
   Win/loss   Each player's standings since they connected. 
    Version   Which version of OMF each player is running. 

Challenge Arena Options:

  Challenge   Challenges the highlighted player.
    Whisper   Sends a message directly to any other player, so that others 
	      don't see it.  You can whisper to a player who is playing
	      a game, but your "yells" only reach players who are in the
	      arena screen.
       Yell   Sends a message to everyone in the challenge arena.
    Refresh   Refreshes the highlighted character.  This option is useful for 
	      updating players' records who are currently in matches, and for 
	      clearing players who may have been disconnected, but still
	      appear in the arena.
       Exit   Returns you to the Main Menu.


New play options available in a modem/network game
--------------------------------------------------

All of the OMF controls are the same, with the following options added:

Chat Mode: 
   You can enter Chat-Mode by pressing ALT-C from anywhere within the game.  
   Messages you type are automatically sent to your opponent.  Press ESCAPE 
   to quit Chat-Mode.

Gameplay Options:
   All of the standard (and Advanced) options can be accesses by pressing 
   ALT-G.  Choose "Done" to return to the game.

Changing System Settings:
   You can change your system settings (such as control, video options, 
   speed, and volume) in the middle of a match by pressing ESCAPE.  Choose 
   "Return to Game" to return to your match.  NOTE: Choosing "Exit" from 
   this menu quits the match and exits to the OMF Challenge Arena.
